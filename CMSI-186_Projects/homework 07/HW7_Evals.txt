   32 out of 34 = 94.12% which is an A

Your DynamicChangemakerTestHarness.java file was not correct.. you named
it incorrectly so it didn't compile.  I fixed it for you, even though I
said in class "no compile, no credit"....

Your JavaDocs don't use the correct format, which I've also mentiond in
class several times; it must start with "/**" not "/*" as you have.

Finally, you are not checking the arguments properly for the extra credit
portion of this exercise.  The described format for running the program
is "java DynamicChangeMaker 2,3,4,5 123".  The denominations are required
to be a COMMA SEPARATED LIST, with the target amount separated from that
by a space.  I also stressed this in class.  When I run your code with
valid input I get an exception.

The "silly goose" comment made me laugh, though.....  :D
