Hi, KeAnna ---

I'm sorry that this has been such a struggle for you, but I'm
glad you have learned a lot from the exercise.  I appreciate
that you have spent so much time on it, and I admire your
persistence in sticking with it to try to find a solution.

I feel that at this point, you have given it your all, and I
feel that should be acknowledged in the evaluation for this
assignment.  I also feel that it's not truly fair to others in
the class who got their BrobInt working, to just hand you the
grade for something that doesn't really work.  This is not
really about the fact that you "used another method for
conversion".  It is about being equitable to all the members
of the class.

To that end, I'm bumping your mark for this assignment to a
C-minus.  If you remember our conversation, I said that if you
got your Fibonacci and your add methods working, you would get
a "C" for the assignment.  I can see that your Fibonacci code
has the proper format, although you don't check the input
arguments.  I also see that your add method isn't really working,
but you have tried hard to clear that hurdle, and except for the
conversion back to decimal it seems you have the right idea.  In
addition, you have a couple of "helper" methods that also seem to
work, so I'm giving you full credit for the add method.  Finally,
the assignment is quite late, and by the stated policy on the
syllabus should rate no credit, so I'm compromising on that.

That brings your numeric score to 72.5% which is a C-minus.

I feel that is fair, and again, this is NOT a penalty for the
particular method you used.  I feel it is a fair reflection of
the overall situation.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Regards,
Professor Johnson
